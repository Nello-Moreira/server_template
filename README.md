# SERVER TEMPLATE

This is a template for building a web server with postgreSQL as database.

## How to run

- Clone this repository
- Install all dependencies

```
npm i
```

- Change the file "create-tables.sql" (./database_scripts/scripts/create-tables.sql) to the desired tables names and variables
- Run on terminal: (at project's root directory)

```
 npx ts-node config.ts
```

This will create a production, a development and a test database and envs variables. It will also create a local user role for postgres database, if it doesn't exist.

- Edit the desired files and run server
